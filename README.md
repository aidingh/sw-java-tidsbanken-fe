# Time Bank Frontend

The primary purpose of this project is to be a capstone experience
for us to utilize what we have learnt during the Noroff accelerated program.

This is the frontend part of the Time Bank project. This application 
serves to manage the request and approval process of vacation days for employees, 
aswell as inform employees about each otherâ€™s approved vacation days 
so that teams may adequately plan for periods of absence.

The backend part of the project can be found here:\
