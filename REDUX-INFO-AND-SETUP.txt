Your redux reducers should be added inside the redux-features folder. 
Create a new one for each use case e.g user, vacation etc.
The boilerplate code for how to setup the actions and reducers is inside "user.js"

In order to use your redux state inside your components you declare a variable like this: const user = useSelector((state) => state.user.value).
In order to change the value of your state you declare: const dispatch = useDispatch(); inside your components.
Then you can import your action and change it with the help of the dispatch e.g dispatch(login({name: "Janne", age: 71, email: "email@gmail.com"})).

Don't forget to add each new redux feature to the store. You can find the store inside "index.js"
